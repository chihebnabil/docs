# What's Included

Every component of your Lovable backend is migrated to your own Supabase project. Here's the complete breakdown.

## Database Migration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schema Structure">
    **All database objects recreated:**
    - Tables (all 370 of them, if that's your case)
    - Columns with correct data types
    - Primary keys
    - Foreign key relationships
    - Unique constraints
    - Check constraints
    - Default values
    - Auto-increment sequences
    
    **What stays identical:**
    - Table names
    - Column names
    - Data types
    - Relationships
    
    **What we validate:**
    - Row counts match
    - Foreign keys resolve correctly
    - Constraints are enforced
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Data Integrity">
    **Data transferred with validation:**
    - All rows migrated
    - Binary data preserved (images, files metadata)
    - JSON/JSONB fields intact
    - Arrays maintained
    - Timestamps converted correctly
    - UUIDs preserved
    
    **Validation process:**
    - Row count verification
    - Sample data checks
    - Relationship integrity tests
    - Constraint validation
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Special Data Types">
    Complex types handled correctly:
    - `uuid` → Preserved
    - `timestamp with time zone` → Maintained
    - `json` / `jsonb` → Intact
    - Arrays (`text[]`, `int[]`) → Preserved
    - Custom enums → Recreated
    - `geometry` (PostGIS) → Migrated with extension
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Indexes & Performance">
    Database performance preserved:
    - B-tree indexes
    - GIN indexes (for JSON/text search)
    - GiST indexes (for PostGIS)

    - Partial indexes
    - Index names maintained
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Row Level Security (RLS)

<Card title="All Policies Migrated" icon="shield-check">
  Every RLS policy from your Lovable database is ported to your new Supabase project.

    - Policy roles
    
    ```sql
    -- Example policy that gets migrated
    CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their own data" 
    ON public.profiles 
    FOR SELECT 
    USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Policy Testing">
    **We verify every policy works:**
