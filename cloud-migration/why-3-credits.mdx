# Why 3 Credits Costs 3x More

<Card title="When you have 370 tables, you're not buying a script. You're buying insurance." icon="shield">
  Complex migrations aren't about running a script—they're about preserving relationships, security policies, and business logic that grew organically. One wrong move and months of user data could be at risk.
</Card>

## The Real Cost Breakdown

Here's where your 3 credits ($237) go:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Analysis & Planning (0.5 credits)">
    **Before touching anything, we map the battlefield:**
    
    - Schema inventory (every table, column, relationship)
    - RLS policy audit (security vulnerabilities)
    - Data volume assessment (GB to transfer)
    - Complexity scoring (simple vs. nested relationships)
    - Risk identification (what could break)
    - Migration strategy (order of operations)
    
    **Time invested**: 2-4 hours of expert analysis
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Schema Migration (0.5 credits)">
    **Recreating your database structure:**
    
    - Table definitions (potentially hundreds of create statements)
    - Foreign key relationships (mapping web of connections)
    - Constraints & indexes (performance preservation)
    - Custom types & enums (PostgreSQL specifics)
    - Triggers & functions (business logic)
    
    **What goes wrong without this**: 
    - Foreign key conflicts
    - Constraint violations
    - Data type mismatches
    - Index corruption
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Data Transfer (1 credit)">
    **The heavy lifting:**
    
    - Batch extraction (not dumping everything at once)
    - Relationship preservation (parent→child integrity)
    - Binary data handling (images, files)
    - JSON/JSONB integrity (complex nested data)
    - Validation checks (every row verified)
    - Error recovery (what if transfer fails mid-way?)
    
    **Time invested**: 4-8 hours of careful transfer
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Security Migration (0.5 credits)">
    **RLS policies—where most migrations fail:**
    
    - Policy extraction (parsing SQL logic)
    - Security function migration (custom auth logic)
    - Permission testing (verify it actually works)
    - Vulnerability audit (are you more secure or less?)
    - Edge case testing (what about null users?)
    
    **Why this matters**: 
    - One broken policy = data exposure
    - One missing policy = unauthorized access
    - One logic error = app broken for users
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Auth Migration (0.5 credits)">
    **User experience preservation:**
    
    - Account migration (metadata, OAuth links)
    - Password reset strategy (communication plan)
    - Testing user flows (sign-in, sign-up, recovery)
    
    **The human factor**:
    - Users need to reset passwords
    - Email templates need updating
    - Support documentation required
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Could Go Wrong (DIY Migration)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Data Corruption">
    **Scenario**: You dump and restore without checking foreign keys.
    
    **Result**: Orphaned records, broken relationships, app crashes.
    
    **Cost to fix**: 40+ hours of manual cleanup, lost user trust.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Security Exposure">
    **Scenario**: RLS policies don't transfer correctly.
    
    **Result**: Users see each other's data. GDPR violation. Legal liability.
    
    **Cost to fix**: Incident response, legal review, reputation damage.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Auth System Down">
    **Scenario**: OAuth providers not reconfigured properly.
    
    **Result**: Users can't log in. Support tickets flood in. Churn spikes.
    
    **Cost to fix**: Emergency hotfix, 24/7 support, lost revenue.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Performance Degradation">
    **Scenario**: Indexes not recreated. Queries that took 50ms now take 5s.
    
    **Result**: App feels broken. Users leave. SEO rankings drop.
    
    **Cost to fix**: Performance audit, query optimization, re-indexing.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Partial Migration">
    **Scenario**: You migrate 300 tables but miss 70. 
    
    **Result**: App works... mostly. Features randomly break. Data inconsistency.
    
    **Cost to fix**: Weeks of debugging, user complaints, patchwork fixes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why Complex Migrations Need Expert Handling

<Card title="When Your Database Has 370 Tables, You're Buying Insurance" icon="shield">
  Complex migrations aren't just about moving data—they're about preserving relationships, security, and business logic that grew organically over months or years.
</Card>

**What makes migrations complex**:

1. **Deep Relationships**: Foreign keys spanning dozens of tables
   - One wrong order = orphaned records
   - Circular dependencies require careful sequencing
   - Self-referencing tables need special handling

2. **RLS Policy Complexity**: Security rules that reference multiple tables
   - Policies spanning junction tables
   - Custom security functions
   - Permission dependencies

3. **Business Logic in Database**: Functions and triggers
   - Automated workflows
   - Data validation rules
   - Audit logging

4. **Scale Matters**:
   - More tables = more things that can go wrong
   - More data = longer transfer time = more risk
   - More users = less tolerance for downtime

**What the 3 credits cover**:
- **Analysis & Planning** (0.5 credits): Understanding your schema
- **Schema Migration** (0.5 credits): Recreating structure safely
- **Data Transfer** (1 credit): Moving data with validation
- **Security Migration** (0.5 credits): Porting RLS without gaps
- **Auth & Testing** (0.5 credits): Users and verification

**The alternative**: DIY migration that could take weeks, risk data loss, or break security.

**Questions to ask yourself**:
1. What's the cost of losing even 1% of your data?
2. How many hours can your team afford to spend on migration?
3. What's the risk of breaking RLS and exposing user data?
4. Can you afford downtime while you figure it out?

If the answer to any of these makes you nervous, the 3 credits are worth it.
