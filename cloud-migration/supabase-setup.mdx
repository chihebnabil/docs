# Supabase Setup

Before we begin the migration, you need a Supabase project ready to receive your data. Here's how to set it up.

## Step 1: Create Your Supabase Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up at supabase.com">
    Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create an account.
    
    **Recommendation**: Use the same email as your Lovable account for easier tracking.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify your account">
    Check your email and click the verification link.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up billing">
    Choose your plan:
    - **Free Tier**: Good for testing (500MB database, 1GB storage)
    - **Pro ($25/month)**: Production-ready (8GB database, 100GB storage)
    - **Team/Enterprise**: Contact Supabase for larger needs
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Create a New Project

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click 'New Project'">
    From your Supabase dashboard, click the "New Project" button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your project">
    **Organization**: Your company or personal org
    
    **Project Name**: Choose something descriptive
    - Good: `myapp-production`
    - Good: `crm-migrated`
    - Avoid: `test`, `new-project`
    
    **Database Password**: 
    - Generate a strong password
    - Save it in your password manager
    - You'll need this for direct database access
    
    **Region**: 
    - Choose closest to your users
    - Consider data residency requirements
    - Common choices: US East (N. Virginia), EU (Frankfurt), Asia (Singapore)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for provisioning">
    Supabase will create your project. This takes 2-3 minutes.
    
    You'll see a loading screen—don't close it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Gather Connection Information

Once your project is created, we need these details:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Project URL" icon="link">
    **Location**: Project Settings → API
    
    **Format**: `https://[project-ref].supabase.co`
    
    **Example**: `https://abc123def456.supabase.co`
    
    **We need this for**: API calls, storage access
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Anon/Public Key" icon="key">
    **Location**: Project Settings → API → Project API Keys
    
    **Format**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIs...`
    
    **We need this for**: Client-side authentication
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Service Role Key" icon="key">
    **Location**: Project Settings → API → Project API Keys
    
    **⚠️ Keep this secret!** Never expose in client code.
    
    **We need this for**: Admin operations during migration
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Database Password" icon="lock">
    **You created this** during project setup.
    
    **We need this for**: Direct PostgreSQL access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
  **Share securely**: Send these credentials via encrypted channel (1Password, secure email, or scheduled call). Never post in public channels.
</Info>

## Step 4: Configure Your Project

### Enable Required Extensions

Go to **Database → Extensions** and enable these (if your app uses them):

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common Extensions">
    - `uuid-ossp` - UUID generation (most apps need this)
    - `pgcrypto` - Cryptographic functions
    - `pg_trgm` - Trigram matching for search
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Advanced Extensions">
    - `postgis` - Geographic data
    - `pgvector` - Vector similarity search
    - `pg_stat_statements` - Query performance
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Set Up Authentication Providers

If you use social login:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Authentication → Providers">
    Enable the providers your app uses (Google, GitHub, Apple, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure OAuth Apps">
    For each provider:
    - Create OAuth app in provider console
    - Add callback URL: `https://[project-ref].supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
    - Copy Client ID and Secret to Supabase
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the flow">
    We'll verify OAuth works during migration testing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Configure Storage (Optional)

If you want specific storage settings:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Storage → Policies">
    Default policies are created automatically, but you can customize.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up CORS (if needed)">
    For client-side uploads from specific domains.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure CDN">
    Supabase provides CDN by default. Contact them for custom domains.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Prepare for Migration

<Check>
  - [ ] Supabase account created
  - [ ] New project provisioned
  - [ ] Region selected (close to users)
  - [ ] Required extensions enabled
  - [ ] Auth providers configured (if using OAuth)
  - [ ] Service role key secured
  - [ ] Database password saved
  - [ ] Project URL documented
</Check>

## Security Checklist

<Warning>
  **Before sharing credentials with us:**
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Row Level Security">
    We'll set this up during migration, but verify it's available.
    
    Go to **Database → Tables** and check that new tables will have RLS.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review API Keys">
    - **Anon key**: Safe for client-side code
    - **Service role key**: NEVER in client code, only server-side
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up backup policy">
    Supabase automatically backs up Pro+ projects. 
    
    Go to **Database → Backups** to verify schedule.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable MFA for your account">
    Protect your Supabase dashboard access.
    
    Go to **Account Settings → Security**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens Next

Once you've completed setup:

1. **Send us your credentials** (securely)
2. **We'll schedule the migration** (usually within 48 hours)
3. **We'll run a test migration** on a subset of data
4. **You'll review the results** and approve
5. **We'll execute the full migration**
6. **You'll update your app** with new connection strings
7. **We'll monitor for 48 hours** to ensure stability

## Post-Migration Connection Details

After migration, you'll need to update your app with these values:

```bash
# Your new Supabase project details
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[your-project-ref].supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGci...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGci...

# Direct database connection (if needed)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project-ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```
