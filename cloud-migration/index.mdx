## Prerequisites

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Your Project Size">
    Not sure if your project is "simple" or "complex"?
    
    **If you have 100+ tables** or integrations with Stripe, OpenAI, or other external APIs, **skip to the White-Glove option**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prepare Your Supabase Project">
    Create a new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) if you haven't already.

## The Migration Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Install Extension & Connect">
    Install the **Lovable Cloud to Supabase** Chrome Extension and connect your credentials.
    
    [Install Extension →](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/lovable-cloud-to-supabase/ekleklhofagefcgokjlgcjkkmlkbdlnp)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="2. Automatic Migration">
    Once connected, the extension clones your Lovable Cloud setup and deploys it to Supabase automatically.
    
    **What's migrated:**
    - **Database Schema** — Tables & rows
    - **Edge Functions** — Serverless logic
    - **Authentication** — Users & permissions
    
    **Complexity Check:**
    Standard schemas migrate automatically. Custom SQL triggers or complex RLS policies may need manual review.
    
    <Info>
      **Migration typically completes in under 5 minutes.** You'll receive a notification when it's ready.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="3. You're Done! 🎉">
    Your project is now running on Supabase with all your data, functions, and users migrated successfully.
  </Step>
