# The Escape Hatch

<Card title="Infrastructure Independence" icon="unlock">
  Use our Chrome Extension to migrate from Lovable's proprietary Supabase instance to your own Supabase project. Full data ownership, custom RLS policies, and production-ready infrastructure. Self-service migration.
</Card>

## This Is Not "Just Moving a Database"

You're buying **complete infrastructure independence**:

  <Card title="Data Migration" icon="database">
    All tables, rows, and relationships transferred to your Supabase
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Auth Migration" icon="shield">
    User accounts, passwords (with reset), OAuth connections
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="RLS Policies" icon="lock">
    Row Level Security rules ported and tested
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Edge Functions" icon="bolt">
    Serverless functions transferred and reconfigured

  <Card title="Database Functions" icon="code">
    PostgreSQL functions and triggers preserved
  </Card>

## Why 3 Credits?

<Warning>
  **When you have 370 tables, you're not buying a script. You're buying insurance.**
</Warning>

The Polish client story: Their Lovable app had grown to 370 tables with complex relationships and custom RLS policies. A manual migration would have taken weeks and risked data corruption.

**What the 3 credits cover:**

1. **Analysis & Planning** (0.5 credits)
   - Schema mapping
   - Relationship analysis
   - Migration strategy

2. **Data Migration** (1 credit)
   - Table-by-table transfer
   - Foreign key preservation
   - Data validation

3. **Auth & Security** (0.5 credits)
   - User account migration
   - OAuth reconfiguration
   - RLS policy porting

4. **Edge Functions** (0.5 credits)
    - Function code migration
    - Environment setup
    - Testing

5. **Testing & Validation** (0.5 credits)
   - End-to-end testing
   - Security verification
   - Performance checks

## The Only Caveat: Password Resets

<Info>
  **Auth sessions cannot be migrated.** Users will need to reset their passwords.
</Info>

This is a technical limitation, not a choice:
- Supabase auth tokens are tied to the project
- Sessions are cryptographically bound
- OAuth providers need reconfiguration

**How we handle it:**
- Pre-migration: Email users about upcoming change
- Post-migration: Trigger password reset flow
- Alternative: Magic link login for seamless transition

## What's Included

The **Lovable Cloud to Supabase** Chrome Extension provides a guided, self-service migration:

## When Do You Need This?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="You're Ready to Launch">
    **The Trigger**: You're about to go live and need your own infrastructure.
    
    **Why Now**: Can't launch on Lovable's shared backend. You need:
    - Dedicated resources
    - Custom domain
    - Direct database access
    - Full control
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="You're Hitting Limits">
    **The Trigger**: Lovable's constraints are blocking you.
    
    **Why Now**: You need:
    - Direct SQL access
    - Custom PostgreSQL extensions
    - Advanced RLS policies
    - Real-time subscriptions
    - Edge functions
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="You've Already Migrated Frontend">
    **The Trigger**: CLI converted your React code, but you're still on their backend.
    
    **Why Now**: Complete the escape. Get full independence from Lovable's ecosystem.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="You're Growing Fast">
    **The Trigger**: 370 tables, thousands of users.
    
    **Why Now**: You need:
    - Scalable infrastructure
    - Performance optimization
    - Dedicated support
    - SLA guarantees
  </Tab>

## What's Different After Migration?

| Feature | Lovable's Backend | Your Supabase |
|---------|------------------|---------------|
| Database Access | Limited | Full PostgreSQL |
| RLS Policies | Basic | Advanced |
| Edge Functions | Restricted | Full access |
| Custom Domain | No | Yes |
| Direct SQL | No | Yes |
| Backups | Managed | Controlled |
| Monitoring | Basic | Advanced |

## What's NOT Included

**Storage/Files**: Storage buckets and file uploads are not migrated as part of this service. You'll need to:
- Set up new storage buckets in your Supabase
- Re-upload files or migrate them separately
- Update file references in your database

**Why?** File migrations are complex, time-consuming, and often require different strategies based on volume and access patterns. We focus on the critical database and auth infrastructure.
