## The Decision Tree

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your current setup">
    Are you still on Lovable's managed Supabase, or do you already have your own?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your frontend">
    Do you have the code exported, or are you still trying to get it out of Lovable?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check your SEO">
    Is Google indexing your pages, or do you see "Lovable builds SPAs" warnings in Search Console?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Three Liberation Stages

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Stage 1: Escape the Frontend">
    **The CLI** — Stop waiting for Lovable to export.
    
    Convert your React Router app to Next.js App Router. Get instant control over your code.
    
    - **What converts**: React hooks, Tailwind classes, React Router patterns
    - **What breaks**: Lovable's magic components, hardcoded API calls
    - **Time to escape**: 5 minutes
    - **Cost**: 1 credit
    
    [Start with CLI →](/cli)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Stage 2: Escape the Backend">
    **Cloud Migration Extension** — Infrastructure independence.
    
    Use our Chrome Extension to migrate from Lovable's Supabase to your own. This isn't just "moving a database" — it's full infrastructure ownership. Self-service migration with guided steps.
    
    - **What's included**: Data migration, RLS policy porting, auth user migration
    - **How it works**: Chrome Extension guides you through connecting your Supabase and executing the migration
    - **The 3x cost is justified**: Complex migrations need expert validation
    - **Caveat**: Users need password reset (session migration not possible)

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Stage 3: Production Polish">
    **SEO Builder Extension** — The difference between migrated and production-ready.
    
    Lovable builds SPAs. Google sees blank pages. Use our Chrome Extension to prerender your app and auto-deploy to Vercel.
    
    - **The problem**: `next build` generates static HTML, but dynamic routes need help
    - **The solution**: Chrome Extension prerenders your routes and deploys to Vercel
    - **Free tier**: New users get 1 free credit to try it out
    - **Credits**: Additional credits for more deployments
